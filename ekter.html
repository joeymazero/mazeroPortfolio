<strong>Ekter and The Cub</strong> is a game developed by my classmates and I in my University's game development club Hoosier Games. It tells a story of redemption while
delivering on top-down 2D action game elements. My teammates and I were selected to show our game at PopCon in Indianapolis, in which we set our game up at a booth
and let passerbys playtest it.

<h4>During this project I developed the following skills:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Producer-like skills such as working in and managing a team in a project management program like HacknPlan.</li>
	<li>To give clearly defined tasks with attainable deadlines to my teammates, so that no one was left with nothing to do.</li>
	<li>To work with programmers, designers, and sound people and develop a sense of unity in our team.</li>
</ul>
