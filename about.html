<p>
<strong>Whether</strong> it be researching new approaches to design, the state of the industry, or my favorite game, it all falls under the umbrella of my love for video games.
I believe that games must be innovative while at the same time be informed of the current trends of the industry, so I go out of my way to experience all different kinds of games.
Creativity can take on all forms, but it does not come from being static. I make sure as a creative I am bringing a well-rounded approach to the worlds I bring to life.
