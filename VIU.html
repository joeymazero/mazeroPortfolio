<strong>VIU</strong> is an augmented reality app focused in orienting parents, new students, and visitors to IU's campus. This app allows users to walk around campus in
real time and tap on significant landmarks, learn more about them, and visit the corresponding Indiana University web page. In addition, users are able to walk around
and examine 3D models with their camera's phone, as well as experience 360 video whilst learning about a certain part of campus.
